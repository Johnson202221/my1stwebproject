       <td>Carol Susan Jane Danvers was born in the mid-1960s as the second child to Joseph Danvers and her mother. Throughout her childhood, she never got along with her parents due to how they treated her based on her gender, yet maintained a good relationship with her older brother, Steve Danvers, who would stargaze with her outside at night. As she grew up, Danvers dreamed of becoming a pilot, idolizing feminine role models like Amelia Earhart. Danvers also developed a determined, rebellious streak that would stick with her for all of her life.</td><br>

    </table><br>
    <table width="1500px">
        <th style="color:yellow;">Despite how her parents felt, Danvers still decided to participate in numerous physical sports and activities, including becoming a baseball player on the team called the "Sparrows," where she faced more challenges being a girl on a boys team. In spite of the fact that she would sometimes be knocked down, Danvers always remained determined to stand back up and continue, while others would believe she should stop, which would go against her character.[1]</th>
        <td><img src="Images/2.jpg" width="300px"></td>
    </table>
    <p style="color:yellow;text-align:justify">Shortly after turning eighteen, Danvers was accepted to the United States Air Force Academy in order to pursue her dream of becoming a pilot. Arriving at the academy many hours early, she killed time by listening to the airplanes taking off while in her Mustang. One after the other, she guessed them right until the last one: a yellow biplane with blue and red accents. At that moment, she decided to pack up and go. When driving away, a black Jaguar blew past her followed by a woman in a blue Honda and a scrape on the side of the car. Realizing the man hit and ran, Danvers drove up to him in a high speed chase. She took a shortcut which brought her by a state trooper, who tried to pull her over. Danvers did not listen and kept going, eventually pulling in front of the man.</p>

    <p style="color:yellow;text-align:justify">She got out to berate him, but the trooper told her to stop. She explained what the man had done. The trooper arrested the man while Danvers sat on the curb. Danvers saw the woman in the Honda walk into the gas station. They nodded at each other before the trooper walked over to Danvers, who caught her name: Wright. The trooper explained that Danvers broke five laws despite her good intentions. Knowing she was getting written up, Danvers worried that she had ruined her first day before starting it. She echoed these thoughts to Wright, who did not want to ruin her future. Wright instead let her off with a warning and a note, "Let yourself learn."[2]</p>
    
    <p>Danvers woke up on the first day at 3:23 AM to find Maria Rambeau already up and ready, getting her shoes on. Danvers asked if she was going running, only to get a look from Rambeau. Realizing how stupid the question was, Danvers asked if she could join her. Rambeau said if she could get ready in seven minutes then yes. Danvers was quickly getting ready when the ticket from Wright fell out of her pocket. Danvers explained what happened and Rambeau exercised the idea that "let yourself learn" meant learning about yourself. Danvers and Rambeau then went out running, but did not go so long as to ruin their first day of assessments.</p>

    <p>As assessments started, they had to run a mile and a half, do one minute of push-ups, sit-ups, and then pull-ups. It acted as a competition where each pair got a certain amount of points. By the mile run, Rambeau, her, Tom Bianchi, and Garrett Pierre were in the lead. Pierre and Bianchi had more pull-ups, but Rambeau had more push-ups and Danvers had more sit-ups. As the race commenced, Danvers and Rambeau eventually placed first and second respectively with Bianchi in third and Pierre in fourth. Rambeau and Danvers talked and Danvers said the men do not matter as long as they do not get in her way. Pierre, Bianchi, and Erik Del Orbe overheard and took exception. Bianchi told her that woman do not fly combat. Rambeau stood up for Danvers asking if he really wanted to go through this when he just lost. Bianchi told her she could always come in first, but he will always be the pilot.</p>

    <p>Chen and Resendiz called everyone in, so they broke off their argument and complied. However, Danvers could not get his words out of her head. In her dorm, Rambeau showed her the Flying Falcons; an elite squadron. If they are the top two in their class and make that squadron, they could not be turned down. Danvers admitted that they will try to turn them down, but Rambeau replied to let them.[8]

        <td>Due to long held restrictions in the United States Air Force at the time, Danvers and Maria Rambeau weren't allowed to fly in combat, despite being just capable, or even better, than any other pilot. However, they were offered a position to become test pilots for Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S., a joint sciences project between the Air Force, S.H.I.E.L.D. and NASA, under the military scientist Doctor Wendy Lawson.</td>

        <th>One morning in 1989, Danvers and Maria Rambeau decided to have a friendly race to the base, with Danvers taking a shortcut to claim victory. Upon their arrival, they discovered Wendy Lawson in an agitated state stating she had lives to save. Noticing she was trying to pilot the Asis aircraft, Danvers volunteered to pilot it instead, concerned for the lives at stake Lawson mentioned. Once the two were airborne in the craft, Lawson provided Danvers with the coordinates for her laboratory.</th>

        <p>Beginning the ascent, they had suddenly noticed an unidentified aircraft approaching them, much to Lawson's fear, who ordered Danvers to get them out of there. Danvers did her best to evade the attacks while she asked what they wanted, which Lawson revealed was her work on board. Danvers managed to pull a maneuver that got her behind the enemy aircraft, but before she could open fire, the aircraft started firing backwards with aft facing armaments.</p>
        <p>These attacks damaged the Asis, causing it to go down from engine damage. While Danvers tried to eject herself and Lawson from the Asis, the function didn't work so she attempted to land the aircraft near a lake and they crashed. As Danvers got out of the Asis to check on Lawson, she noticed that her blood was blue. Danvers helped her out of the Asis, where Lawson told her that she is not Wendy Lawson, but a Kree scientist named Mar-Vell from Hala. Mar-Vell then warned Danvers to escape so she doesn't also become a casualty in the war she had been fighting.</p>
        <p>Mar-Vell also told Danvers to remember the coordinates so she could finish her mission, as Mar-Vell then pulled out an alien pistol trying to destroy the Light-Speed Engine. By surprise, Mar-Vell was murdered before she could fire, causing Danvers to pick up the pistol to defend herself from Yon-Rogg. He asked Danvers where the core was, but she bluffed him by informing him that he would be surrounded soon, in the hopes he'd run from a threat of a show of force.</p>
